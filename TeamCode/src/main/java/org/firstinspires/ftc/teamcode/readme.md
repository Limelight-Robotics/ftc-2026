# TeamCode Module
This module contains the source code for the robot! We don't want to edit anything in the [./FtcRobotController/](FtcRobotController/) folder, as that is the base code provided by FIRST. Instead, we will be editing code in this module.

## TeleOps
- [Manual Drive](ManualDrive.java): The main manual TeleOp used for driving the robot.
